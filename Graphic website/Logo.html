                <h3>Canvas Size & BackgroundüñºÔ∏è</h3>

                <p>I started off by opening photoshop and selected a dimension size of 600x600, 
                which is around standard for logos. I then filled the background with a dark
                purple colour using the paint bucket tool. Next, I added a faded light pink
                -orange to the bottom of the canvas, this was done by selecting the gradient
                tool, selecting the gradient colour to pink-orange and drawing a vertical 
                line down the canvas </p>

                <h3>Retro Sun‚òÄÔ∏è</h3>

                <p>To draw the raising sun in the logo, I stared by creating a circle using the 
                elliptical marquee tool and gave it a yellow to pink fade, once again, using
                the gradient tool. To create the transparent horizontal lines, I used the
                rectangle marquee tool to draw out rectangles and pressing the ‚Äúdel‚Äù key 
                on they keyboard to remove pieces of the sun, this gave the sun a retro 
                mirage effect.</p>

                <div class="picture_column">
                    <img src="images/logo-sun-select.PNG" alt="Retro sun sun selected with horizontal lines cut out" width="" height="">

            </section>

            <section>
                <h3>Palm Tree silhouetteüå¥</h3>

                <p>With a similar process to the poster, when adding the palm tree I decided 
                to make it into a silhouette. I did this by using the paint bucket tool
                once the palm tree was selected and filling it in white. I then copied and 
                pasted the white silhouette of a palm tree onto the logo in front of the sun
                and added the belnd effect "Subtract", because this made the palm tree black 
                giving it the effect of a shadow.</p>
                
                <div class="picture_column">
                    <img src="images/poster-palmtree.PNG" alt="Palm Tree selected using photoshop selection tool" width="" height="">

                <h3>Text Effectsüî∏</h3>

                <p>Finally, I added text with a warp effect, which curves the text inline
                with the curvature of the sun I placed earlier. Finally, to make the
                text less plain and give it more life I added two effects to the text,
                ‚Äúbevel and emboss‚Äù, which gives the text a 3D effect and ‚ÄúGradient
                overlay‚Äù, which I used to give a slight orange glow to the bottom
                of the wording. </p>
