                <h3>Beach Waves.mp3🌊</h3>

                <p>To create the audio clip, I used the free audio editing software Audacity. 
                This audio clip is made form 4 separate clips: “Beach Waves.mp3”, 
                “Beer Can Opening.mp3”, “Seagull Call.mp3” and “Slurping.mp3”, all these clips
                being mp3 files. Once Audacity was open I Imported the first 20 seconds 
                of the audio file “Beach Waves.mp3” , I then cut off 5 seconds off 
                the end of the clip, but highlighting it and pressing the “del” key, I 
                also reduced the sound clips volume by 27 decibel .</p>

            <section>
                <h3>Seagull Call.mp3🐦</h3>

                <p>Next, I added the “Seagull Call.mp3” audio clip in a separate track. However,
                with this clip I used the whole thing, but I split the clip, by clicking 
                where I wanted it to be split and pressed “ctrl+i”. After, to move the 
                clip I selected the “time shift tool” and slid the second part of the audio
                clip more to the right. Since the clip ended so abruptly, I added a fade 
                out effect by highlighting the part I wanted to be faded and pressed 
                effect>fade out.</p>

            </section>

            <section>
                <h3>Beer Can Opening.mp3🍺</h3>

                <p>Then I imported the “Beer Can Opening.mp3” audio file and trimmed 3 seconds of empty 
                noise at the end and reduced the volume by 15 decibels to make the sounds 
                more immersive to the previous sounds. When playing back the audio I noticed
                that the clip contained a little bit of static noise, to get around this I 
                highlighted a section with just the static and went to effect>noise reduction 
                and clicked “get noise profile”, I then applied that to the whole clip.</p>

            <section>
                <h3>Slurping.mp3🥤</h3>

                <p>Finally, the last clip I included was “Slurping.mp3”. originally the audio file 
                included various slurping sounds, however I picked one which I felt sounded 
                appropriate for my audio and removed all the other ones, next I moved it into 
                place and reduced the volume by 10 decibels, so that the sounds was not overpowering.</p>
