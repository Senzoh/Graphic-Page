            <h2>🎨How I made The Poster🎨</h2>

            <section>
                <h3>Canvas size & Background🖼️</h3>

                <p>I started off by opening photoshop and selected a dimension size of 2480x3508. 
                I then drew a circle on the screen using the marquee tool and filled the outside
                of the circle with a pink colour and the inner circle a dark navy. Next, I made 
                new layer called “noise” with the same size circle and added static to this circle,
                by selecting filter > noise > add noise and changing the blend mode from “Normal” 
                to “color dodge” along with moving the circle slightly to the top left giving it 
                a 3D effect. </p>

                </div>

                <div class="picture_column">
                    <img src="images/poster-background.PNG" alt="photoshop circle in the middle of the screen screen filled in with noise" width="" height="">

            <section>
                <h3>Statue🗿</h3>

                <p>To make the composite image I got a photograph of Michelangelo’s statue of David 
                and using the quick selection tool, in another photoshop tab, to selected only 
                the statue from the photograph. Next, I smoothed and feathered the selected area 
                by going into select > select and mask, then I copy statue and pasted it into my 
                main work and added a stroke transparent effect to it. I added a black rectangle
                over the statues genitals by drawing a rectangle using the marquee tool and 
                filling it in black, also adding text over the eyes of the statue and adding a 
                white stroke effect to the text. </p>

                <h3>Palm Tree silhouette🌴</h3>

                <p>I went through a similar process when adding the palm tree, however instead of
                copy and pasting the image of the palm tree, I decided to make it into a 
                silhouette. I did this by using the paint bucket tool once the palm tree was 
                selected and filling it in white. I then copied and pasted the white silhouette
                of a palm tree into my work and added the blend effect “Color Dodge” Which gave 
                the palm tree a neon blue look.</p>
                
                <div class="picture_column">
                    <img src="images/poster-palmtree.PNG" alt="Palm Tree selected using photoshop selection tool" width="" height="">

                <h3>Grid Floor🌐</h3>

                <p>To create the Pink floor grid, I made a new layer called grid and once again 
                selected flirter then Vanishing point, from here I just drew out a grid.
                Next, I added two effects “color overlay”, which changed the colour of 
                the grid and “outer glow”, which gave it a glow effect.</p>
                
                <div class="picture_column"> 
                    <img src="images/poster-grid.PNG" alt="3D rendering the grid in the image" width="" height="">

            <section>
                <h3>Blend Filter🎛️</h3>

                <p>Finally, to give the image an old vintage VHS look, I overlayed a black image 
                of VHS distortion and added the blend mode “Screen”, this completed the
                image.  </p>
